  <h3>Education and Early Life</h3>
  <p class = shift>Luis von Ahn was born and grew up in Guatemala City. When he was eight, his mother bought him a Commodore 64, which fueled his start into the field of computer science. Von Ahn earned a BS in Mathematics in 2000 from Duke and a PhD in Computer Science in 2005 from Carnegie Mellon where he later became a faculty member in 2006.</p>

  <h3>Research and Innovation</h3>
  <p class = shift>Luis von Ahn first started to research cryptography and steganography, proving that private-key steganography is possible. After receiving his bachelor's degree, von Ahn worked on CAPTCHAs, which he later profited from, coining the term CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart). During this early work on CAPTCHAs, von Ahn started to gain widespread fame from the media coverage. For his PhD, von Ahn coined the term "human computation" referring to the ability of humans and computers to solve problems together that neither would be able to solve separately. His PhD is also the first work on Games with a Purpose, which are games played by humans that produce useful computation as well. One of these games is the ESP Game which pairs two players randomly and shows the same image while prompting for descriptions, players gain a point for every descriptor in common. These descriptors in common get paired with the picture to create accurate generated descriptions. Google licensed this data and software for their Google image search.</p>
  <p class = shift>In 2007, von Ahn used his research on CAPTCHAs to develop reCAPTCHA, a form of CAPtCHA that also digitizes books. Images of words from books are displayed to the user to transcribe. Two images were shown, one was to transcribe the other was to verify the user. If a word is transcribed by many humans to the same word but not matching computer generations, the word gets added to the verification database. Google later bought reCAPTCHA for an undisclosed amount. Luis von Ahn and a graduate student started to work on a language education platform. They founded a company called Duolingo with von Ahn as the CEO and Severin Hacker, the graduate assistant, as CTO.</p>

  <h3>Duolingo CEO</h3>
  <p class = "shift">Von Ahn knew how expensive it was for people in Guatemala to learn English and Hacker thought free education would change the world. Duolingo was launched for private beta in 2011 and released to the public in 2012. The waiting list was at 500,000 when released. In 2013, Duolingo introduced a crowdsourced language model which was discontinued in 2021. In 2023, Duolingo released math and music courses in both English and spanish. In 2024, after laying off ten percent of contractors, Duolingo is using AI driven coding to replace tasks typically done by contractors. Today, the site has over 500 million users with 74 million monthly active users. They currently have courses in the following languages: Arabic, Catalan, Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Guarani, Haitian Creole, Hawaiian, Hebrew, High Valyrian, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Klingon, Korean, Latin, Navajo, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Scottish Gaelic, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Welsh, Yiddish, and Zulu.</p>
